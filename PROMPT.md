# GambleFights - Project Mission

**Goal**: Build a provably fair, 50/50 animated crypto battle game.

## Core Requirements
1.  **Provably Fair**: 100% transparent RNG using HMAC SHA256.
2.  **Visuals**: High-quality 3D animations (Unity WebGL) for fight visualization.
3.  **Speed**: Instant deposits/withdrawals (SOL/TON) and fast game loops.
4.  **Integrity**: Strict anti-cheat, multi-account prevention, and secure wallet handling.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (React, Tailwind, Zustand).
*   **Backend**: Go (Echo/Fiber, PostgreSQL, Redis).
*   **Animation**: Unity WebGL (managed by "Dumb Client" logic).

## Methodology (The Ralph Way)
*   **@fix_plan.md**: Follow this task list strictly.
*   **specs/**: Refer to detailed specifications here.
*   **@AGENT.md**: Use this for build/test context.
